# Did you know mathematicians have little knowledge about this infinite sum besides irrationality?
# Problems surrounding this sum, and the zeta function associated with its calculation are far-stretching in the world of mathematics
# This program approximates such sum, where the error is negligible.
# From this program I found that .601 is approximately 1/2 of the infinite sum of 1/k^3!
